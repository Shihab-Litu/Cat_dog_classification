# Cat_dog_classification


There are two types of image on the training set which is cat and dog. Properly Read and visualize the image. Rescale the image and convert it to numpy array. 

Buid a Convulational Neural Network to identify feature of cat and dog. use dropout to avoid overfitting. Before input the image apply image data  generator to augment the data.

After that I have applied Transfer learning instead of scratch model. Finally I have tested the test image & sucessfully identify cat and dog.


Requirement to Run the code:

pandas 
numpy
matplotlib
open cv

Further task to improve the result:
To build new model from scratch with some variation can improve the result.
